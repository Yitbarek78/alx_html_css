## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a growing passion for building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. While studying, I spent 4+ years working as a satellite dish installer — an experience that sharpened my hands-on problem solving and customer-facing communication skills.

Currently, I’m focused on **frontend web development**, learning tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I love turning creative ideas into functional, accessible web experiences.
